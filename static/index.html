            <p>The story begins with Japan’s elimination from the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which prompts the Japanese
                Football Union to start a programme scouting high school players who will begin training in preparation
                for the 2022 Cup. Isagi Youichi, a forward, receives an invitation to this programme soon after his team
                loses the chance to go to Nationals because he passed to his less-skilled teammate – who missed –
                without trying to make the game-changing goal by himself. Their coach will be Ego Jinpachi, who intends
                to “destroy Japanese loser football” by introducing a radical new training regimen: isolate 300 young
                forwards in a prison-like institution called “Blue Lock” and put them through rigorous training aimed at
                creating “the world’s greatest egotist striker.”</p>

            <p>"Blue Lock" is a sports manga series that focuses on the story of a group of talented young soccer
                players who are selected to join the Blue Lock project, a unique training program designed to create the
                perfect striker for the Japanese national team.</p>
            <p>
                In the manga, the Blue Lock project is set up in a large, isolated prison-like facility. The facility is
                surrounded by a high wall and has a number of watchtowers and security cameras to prevent anyone from
                escaping. The project is led by a former professional soccer player named Ego Jinpachi, who believes
                that the traditional soccer training methods are ineffective in producing world-class strikers.
            </p>
            <p>The inmates of Blue Lock are all talented young soccer players, who have been scouted from across Japan
                based on their abilities as strikers. The goal of the project is to create a single perfect striker who
                can win games on their own. To achieve this goal, the inmates are put through a rigorous and intense
                training program, which involves competing against each other to earn points and advance through the
                levels of the program.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                <p>The training at Blue Lock is designed to be highly competitive and isolating, with the goal of pushing
                    each player to their limits and forcing them to develop their own unique style of play. The players are
                    also closely monitored and evaluated by the coaching staff, who use advanced analytics and data analysis
                    to determine each player's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                <p>In summary, Blue Lock is a fictional soccer training program in the form of a prison-like facility,
                    designed to create the perfect striker for the Japanese national team. The players are put through a
                    highly competitive and isolating training program, with the goal of pushing them to their limits and
                    developing their own unique style of play.</p>
